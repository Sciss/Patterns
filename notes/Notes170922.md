# Event arguments

Looking at `ListPatterns.sc`, there is a hack in place to look for `inval.eventAt('reverse') == true` for some
patterns that support reverse iteration order. A more principled way would be to indicate reversibility by
a sub-type of `Pattern` that supports `reverseIterator` or such.

# Constants

aka the strange case of `Object:next` versus `Stream.next`. So patterns either use `asStream` through calls to
`next` or through a call to `embedInStream`. The behaviour of constants has an anomaly here: While a `Pattern` will 
respond to `asStream` by return a `Stream`, this is not the case for primitive values which instead return themselves,
so `1.asStream == 1`, i.e. an instance of `Integer`. Now `next`/`value` on a primitive will repeat that object forever,
whereas `embedInStream` only embeds it once, as opposed to `Stream` which consistently iterates through `next`/`value`
when using `embedInStream`.

In short, we have a context dependency through which primitives are either infinite streams or singleton streams.
Example of infinite: `offset` parameter in `Pseq`. Example of singleton: as element in the list of `Pseq`.

- `Pgeom`: `var growStr = grow.asStream`, followed by iterative calls `growVal = growStr.next(inval)`
- `Pseq` : `inval = item.embedInStream(inval)`
