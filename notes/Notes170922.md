# Event arguments

Looking at `ListPatterns.sc`, there is a hack in place to look for `inval.eventAt('reverse') == true` for some
patterns that support reverse iteration order. A more principled way would be to indicate reversibility by
a sub-type of `Pattern` that supports `reverseIterator` or such.
