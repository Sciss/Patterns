# Purely Declarative Approach?

Would it be possible to implement the tuple example in a purely declarative way?
If so how, and would it be favourable over a more direct imperative escape hook
using captured closures in a special kind of graph element?

Let's analyse the `def spawner` content.

- There are two "outer" patterns which are used as eager streams (iterators),
  `lPat` (draw a length value) and `rPat` (draw a fraction for inserting pauses).
- There is an infinite loop

Some 'commands' aka inner patterns would have to be 're-instantiated' for each
iteration of the outer loop. It would therefore make sense to establish the notion
of nested patterns and a way to 'reset' them. A bit like we nested synth graphs with
the ScalaCollider-voices project.
