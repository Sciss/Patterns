# Reset

Properties

- it must be possible to call `reset` repeatedly; calling `reset` more than once
  without intermittent `next` / `moveNext` must have the same effect as calling it only once
- a pattern/stream that is reset may make use of input patterns/streams which are _not_ reset
- reset goes "from outside to inside", i.e. if a pattern/stream A is reset, then it is implied
  that `reset` is also called on any dependants of A, i.e. any patterns/streams that use A
  as input
- this in turn implies that it is not possible for a dependant to not notice when any of its
  inputs is reset
