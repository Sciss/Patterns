# AuralAttribute

In order to use a `Pattern[S]` as input to a scalar control of `Proc`, or within a `Grapheme`, we must
implement `AuralAttribute`. We can probably use the base trait `AuralScheduledBase`.

Because we don't have random access into the stream, the strategy could be to unroll a memoised version
of the stream, until the current point in time required by methods such as `modelEventAfter`.

Perhaps getting most DRY of translating the various pattern elements into something that gives values
for aural-target, we can use `Obj[S#I]` from which to make `type Elem = AuralAttribute[S#I]`. That gives
us `val viewTree: SkipList.Map[I, Long, Vec[AuralAttribute[I]]]` as a container for views, and we can
use most of the existing implementation.
