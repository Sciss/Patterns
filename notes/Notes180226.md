# Interference of fold-left and flow

Consider the following example:

    val plain = (1 to 2).flatMap { _ =>
      val xs  = Seq(Seq(1), Seq(2, 3))
      val xsi = xs.indices.iterator
      xs.foldLeft(Seq[Int]()) { (accum, x) =>
        val a = xsi.next()
        val z = x.map { y =>
          y + a
        }
        accum ++ z
      }
    }

    val pat: Pat[Int] = Graph {                 // level 1
      Pat.loop(2) {                             // level 2
        val xs  = Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3))
        val xsi = xs.indices.flow()
        xs.foldLeft(Pat[Int]()) { (accum, x) => // level 3
          val xi = xsi.hold()
          val z = x.bubble.flatMap { y =>       // level 4
            y + xi
          }
          accum ++ z
        }
      }
    }
    
The expected result is `Seq(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4)`, but the actual result (as of this writing)
is `Seq(1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4)`. Why is this so? The reason is the duplicate expansion of `xsi`
after the re-writing of the fold-left, from

    FoldLeft(
      outer     = Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3)),
      z         = Pat(),
      itIn      = It(1),
      itCarry   = It(2),
      inner = Cat(
        It(2),
        FlatMap(
          outer = Grouped(It(1),1),
          it    = It(3),
          inner = BinaryOp(Plus,It(3),
            Hold(Flow(Indices(Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3))), level = 2), true)),
          innerLevel = 4)
      )
    )

to a fold-left with a new inner value of

    Cat(
      Cat(
        Pat(),
        FlatMap(
          outer = Grouped(Pat(1),1),
          it    = It(1000000001),
          inner = BinaryOp(Plus,It(1000000001),
            Hold(Flow(Indices(Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3))), level = 2), true)),
          innerLevel = 4)
      ),
      FlatMap(
        outer = Grouped(Pat(2, 3),1),
        it    = It(1000000002),
        inner = BinaryOp(Plus,It(1000000002),
          Hold(Flow(Indices(Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3))), level = 2),true)),
        innerLevel = 4)
    )

(An even more complicated case would be another `Pat.loop(2)` around the `foldLeft` call.)

Two things:

- the `Flow` must not be duplicated; or more precisely, the pattern may be duplicated,
  but the expansion of the stream must not be duplicated; a first attempt might be to
  assign it a uniqueID obtained from the graph builder
- the outer `Cat` iteration must ensure that the order of the polling of the flow stream
  is correct. This was not a problem before, as the streams came from purely functional
  patterns and could simply be duplicated.
  
Let's look at the second issue. According to the above expansion,
the most likely branch to pull first (N.B. probably through `hasNext`) is the one 
using `Pat(1)`, i.e. the first iteration of `foldLeft`.

What if we had `z ++ accum` instead of `accum ++ z`?

    Cat(
      FlatMap(
        outer = Grouped(Pat(2, 3),1),
        it    = It(1000000001),
        inner = BinaryOp(Plus,It(1000000001),
          Hold(Flow(Indices(Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3))),2),true)),
        innerLevel = 4),
      Cat(
        FlatMap(
          outer = Grouped(Pat(1),1),
          it    = It(1000000002),
          inner = BinaryOp(Plus,It(1000000002),
            Hold(Flow(Indices(Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3))),2),true)),
          innerLevel = 4),
        Pat()
      )
    )
    
Now the branch to pull first most likely is the one using `Pat(2, 3)`.
While the rewriting was fine from a purely functional point of view,
it is now infected by the assumed iteration (execution) logic of `foldLeft`...
We have a conflict between pull (functional) and push (imperative) models
it seems.

# Life without `.flow()`?

At this point I'm fairly pessimistic that we can implement correct `.flow()`
behaviour without an entirely new (push?) architecture. Even if we solve the
uniqueID problem and avoid stream duplication, it will impossible or near to
impossible to avoid confusing order-of-execution issues with the usage of the
values. Can we do without `flow()`?

To answer that, we need to look at the use cases so far. First is the use
of a continuous walk across iterations:

    val lPat = Pat.loop()((8 to 12).mirror).flow()
    Pat.loop() {
      val cantus = (Brown(-6, 6, 3) * 2.4 + 4.0).take(lPat)
      ...
    }
    
The goal is to take _a next value_ from the mirror motion for each iteration
of `Pat.loop() { }`. To remove `flow`, we should thus flat-map over `lPat` instead:

    val lPat = Pat.loop()((8 to 12).mirror)
    lPat.bubble.flatMap { len =>
      val cantus = (Brown(-6, 6, 3) * 2.4 + 4.0).take(len)
      ...
    }

This has the nice effect of removing the cognitive load of understand the interaction
between `flow` and `take`. Also, generalising, instead of `bubble`, we might have
something like `grouped(n)` in many other cases, as a natural way to create shared
buffers.

## Another example

Iterating over collection with indices, assuming there is no dedicated `mapWithIndices`.
That's the initial example:

    val pat: Pat[Int] = Graph {                 // level 1
      Pat.loop(2) {                             // level 2
        val xs  = Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3))
        val xsi = xs.indices.flow()
        xs.foldLeft(Pat[Int]()) { (accum, x) => // level 3
          val xi = xsi.hold()
          val z = x.bubble.flatMap { y =>       // level 4
            y + xi
          }
          accum ++ z
        }
      }
    }

We can forget about the nesting levels again.
Rewrite as

    val pat: Pat[Int] = Graph {
      Pat.loop(2) {
        val xs  = Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3))
        val c   = (xs zip xs.indices).bubble
        c.foldLeft(Pat[Int]()) { (accum: Pat[Int], tup: Pat[(Pat[Int], Int)]) =>
          val (xt, xi) = tup.unzip
          val x = xt.flatten
          val z = x.bubble.flatMap { y =>
            y + xi
          }
          accum ++ z
        }
      }
    }

So is _doable_, but looks very awkward. The annoying extra bubbling level and
`unzip` are necessary because we have no way to get from `Pat[Pat[A]], Pat[Int]`
to `Pat[Pat[(A, Int)]]` (well, this would still need `unzip`.)

As one solution, although not optimal, we could add `WithIndex` variants to
`foldLeft`, `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`. With those hypothetical additions, the
example became

    val pat: Pat[Int] = Graph {
      Pat.loop(2) {
        val xs = Pat(Pat(1), Pat(2, 3))
        xs.foldLeftWithIndex(Pat[Int]()) { (accum, x, xi) =>
          val z = x.bubble.flatMap { y =>
            y + xi
          }
          accum ++ z
        }
      }
    }

## A third example

Following the `grouped` strategy mentioned above. Before:

    val ex2 = Graph {
      val b = Brown(0, 100, 2).flow()
      Pat.loop(4) {
        val d = b.take(10).distinct.sorted
        d ++ Pat(-1)
      }
    }

After:

    val ex2 = Graph {
      val b = Brown(0, 100, 2)
      b.grouped(10).take(4).flatMap { block =>
        val d = block.distinct.sorted
        d ++ Pat(-1)
      }
    }
