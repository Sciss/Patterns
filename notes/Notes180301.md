So as of today, one iteration (with RNG seed 0) in ron-tuple-pure yields 73937 stream expansions
from 31580 pats (150 input patterns), four iterations yield 94673 streams from 43960 pats, 
24 iterations yield 140936 streams from 72696 pats, ...

For numIter = 1:

- Graph {} took 98ms
- expand   took 46ms
- toList   took 482ms

For numIter = 4:

- Graph {} took 98ms
- expand   took 47ms
- toList   took 578ms
- ratio: 144.5

For numIter = 24:

- Graph {} took 103ms
- expand   took 45ms
- toList   took 701ms

For numIter = 40:

- Graph {} took 103ms
- expand   took 55ms
- toList   took 872ms
- ratio: 21.8

For numIter = 400:

- Graph {} took 101ms
- expand   took 57ms
- toList   took 2660ms
- ratio: 6.65

For numIter = 4000:

- Graph {} took 98ms
- expand   took 46ms
- toList   took 65061ms
- ratio: 16.26525

With warmed up JVM, for numIter = 4, toList goes down to 76ms, or a ratio of 19, close to the
value of the higher iterations.

That's still pretty slow for a reasonably small program. For a better picture, we need a
thorough benchmark, and probably that way we can determine the strongest bottlenecks,
possibly where intermediate `List` and `Vector` instances are created.

Of course, if you expand a structure with a duration of 30 seconds within 1213ms computation
time, that's still "ok", but the latency is not nice.
